# Unify

#### Forget about testing.

Unify is a tool meant to make your life easier. It allows you to write tests and
documentation at the same time, greatly reducing the time and effort spent
delivering software. Unify makes a great complement to BDD processes and tools,
like Behat.

Unify fits naturally with how we, as developers, approach software development.
Write your amazing new app and document your API, providing plenty of examples. Your
users and coworkers will love you and, amazingly, your code will be tested. You'll
completely forget that you were writing tests the whole time. Unfortunately, we can't
help you forget about all the time you slaved over unit tests before Unify.
